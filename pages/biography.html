                    <p class="biografia--txt">Jason Moran was born January 21, 1975 in Houston, Texas. He began studying
                        the
                        piano at age 6, but longed to quit the instrument until he first experienced the sounds of jazz
                        legend Thelonious Monk, an experience that renewed his interest in music and established an
                        early
                        role model in his creative development.</p>
                    <p class="biografia--txt">Moran went on to attend Houston's High School for the Performing and
                        Visual
                        Arts where he became an active member of the jazz program, playing in the big band and leading a
                        jazz quartet. His aspirations and talents eventually led him to New York City where he continued
                        his
                        education at the Manhattan School of Music, a school to which he was drawn by the prospect of
                        studying with the pianist Jaki Byard, a jazz leftist who became Moran's teacher for 4 years and
                        a
                        role model for life. It was during this time that Moran also took lessons from other
                        forward-thinking pianists such as Muhal Richard Abrams and Andrew Hill, creative musicians who
                        imparted a profound influence on Moran, and encouraged him to find his own distinct voice.</p>
                    <p class="biografia--txt">In 1997, while Moran was still a senior in college, the drummer Eric
                        Harland,
                        a high school classmate of Moran's, recommended him to saxophonist Greg Osby who was in the
                        process
                        of assembling a band for a European tour. Osby hired Moran based solely on Harland's description
                        of
                        his playing, and the match proved to be auspicious. The connection between Osby and Moran was
                        present as soon as they hit the bandstand, and Moran has become a fixture in Osby's touring and
                        recording bands ever since.</p>

                <div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="900" data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine">
                    <p class="biografia--txt">Moran made his professional recording debut on Osby's 1997 Blue Note CD,
                        Further Ado, which brought him to the attention of Blue Note executives who signed the pianist
                        to
                        his own record deal shortly thereafter. The association with Blue Note is fitting, placing Moran
                        in
                        the lineage of innovative pianist/composers whose career beginnings were nurtured by the veteran
                        jazz label, musicians such as Monk, Herbie Hancock and Herbie Nichols.</p>
                    <p class="biografia--txt">Moran's debut recording as a leader, Soundtrack to Human Motion, which
                        found
                        him in the company of Osby, Harland, vibraphonist Stefon Harris and bassist Lonnie Plaxico, was
                        released in 1999 to great critical praise (Ben Ratliff of <em>The New York Times</em> named it
                        the
                        best album of the year). The following year's Facing Left found Moran stripping down to a trio
                        with
                        bassist Tarus Mateen and drummer Nasheet Waits, and prompted <em>JazzTimes </em>magazine to
                        declare
                        the album “an instant classic.” Moran augmented the trio for his third Blue Note release, Black
                        Stars, adding avant-garde icon Sam Rivers, who plays saxophone, flute and piano on the
                        recording.
                        Gary Giddins of the <em>Village Voice</em> exclaimed “<em>Black Stars</em> is possibly a Blue
                        Note
                        benchmark, definitely one of the year's outstanding discs.”</p>

                    <p class="biografia--txt">Moran has performed as a sideman with such artists as Cassandra Wilson,
                        Joe
                        Lovano, Don Byron, Steve Coleman, Lee Konitz, Von Freeman, Ravi Coltrane, and Stefon Harris. He
                        was
                        the youngest honoree of the New Work Commission by the San Francisco Jazz Festival. He was also
                        awarded a grant from Chamber Music America's New Works: Creation and Presentation program, which
                        is
                        funded by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. For these two grants Moran used sampled
                        conversations as vocal triggers. These compositions would be the foundation for many of Moran's
                        new
                        compositions. Jazziz magazine wrote “Moran is blessed with the courage of his own
                        convictions—part
                        scavenger and part seer, fluent in the cut/paste/splice devices of hip hop production….”</p>
                    <p class="biografia--txt">In 2002, Moran released his universally acclaimed solo piano disc
                        Modernistic.
                        The Cork Jazz Festival awarded Moran the 2002 Guiness Rising Star Award. 2003's The Bandwagon,
                        culled from the trio's six-day stint at New York's Village Vanguard, earned the team of
                        Moran-Mateen-Waits a title as “the best new rhythm section in jazz” (<em>The New York
                            Times</em>)
                        and caused <em>Rolling Stone </em>to proclaim Moran “the most provocative thinker in current
                        jazz.”

                            Fats
                            Waller</em>, a collaboration with the vocalist Meshell Ndegeocello that recasts the music of
                        the
                        legendary jazz entertainer Fats Waller as a modern dance party. The album is the studio
                        culmination
                        of a project that was born onstage at Harlem Stage Gatehouse as the Fats Waller Dance Party in
                        2011
                        as part of their “Harlem Jazz Shrines” series.</p>
